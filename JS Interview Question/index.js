// 1. Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators?

// == it compare the value of variables,not data type
// === it compare the value and data type of 2 variables

// What is the spread operator?

// Its used in the variable array where there is more than 1 values are expected. 
// it allows us the privilege to obtain a list of parameters from an array.

// What are the differences between var, let and const?

// let - 1.They can be declared in a line and then intialized with a value in the another lines.
    //   2.They can be also declared and intialized in the same line.
    //   3. They cannot have be also redeclared But can be reintialized.
    //   4. We cannot have Two variable with same name in Let.

// Const - 1. They can be declared in a line and then intialized with a value in the same line only.
    //     2. They cannot be redeclared.
    //     3. But const  cannot be reinitialized also.
    //     4. We cannot have Two  variable with same name in const.

// Var - 1.They can be declared in a line and then intialized with a value in the another lines.
    //   2.They can be also declared and intialized in the same line.
    //   3. They cannot have be also redeclared But can be reintialized.
    //   4. We can have Two or more variables with same name in Var.

// What is execution context?

// In the First stage Memory Allocation all the variables will get memory but will not be initialized.

// What is meant by first class functions?

// A programming language is said to have First - Class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable. 

// What are closures?

// A closures is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with refernces to its surrounding state.
//  In other words a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function
